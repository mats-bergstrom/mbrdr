mbrdr -- Modbus Reader

Reads data from a Huawei SUN2000 Solar Inverter and publishes the data
using MQTT.

These are braindead!

The on-line fora are full of suggestions on how to read out data with
confidence but no real good infomration seems to be available.  The
Huawei responces indicate they do not have any ida why reading data
using modbus sometimes works, sometimes not.

After experimening, I managed to cook up an algorithm that seems to
work (so far).  In pseudo code it looks like:

1    Establish a TCP connection.
2    Sleep 5 s.
3    For each parameter to read
4    	 read a parameter
5		send a modbus package
6		read the responce with a timeout of 5 s.
7	 sleep 2 s before reading the the next parameter

I.E. the modbus slave (renamed server some time ago) cannot cope with
incoming requests too quickly.

1: It needs a delay of several seconds after a TCP connection is
   established bef ore the first request is received, too quick and it
   does not respond at all, 5 s seems to have a very log failure rate.
2: The slave also needs a very long time before it responds, using a 5 s
   time-out gives a very low failure rate.
3: Requests must be separated by a long duration.  2 s gives a very low
   failure rate.

Note that ANY fault in the timing or using the wrong modbus id results
in no responce at all (time-out).

To provide an inverter in the 1500-2000 USD range with this kind
timing issues is really weird.

I used libmodbus for the modbus communication.  It works great but as
I prefer static linking for this I added a few scripts to build and
create a static library to link with.
